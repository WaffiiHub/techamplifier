Some young ones never really give much thought to this question because it all seems laid out for them what they're supposed to do, and this is as a result of what the normal practice has always been in regards to this question. Like we all know the normal answers to this question - either get a job as a sales-person, go stay with a relative, learn a new skill, that will fetch you money, or for those who took the JAMB exams, is to wait for admission.



Every path you're on right now, ask yourself why you're on it and what you plan to get while you're on it. This would help you know if you're on the right or wrong path. It is not always easy to make it by working with the trend and doing what every other person is doing. The market is tight. First, everyone wanted to complete university and get their first degree and get a cool job because the demand for first-degree holders was high, then the demand for first-degree holders changed to fit those having master's degrees, PhD, and some people went to get these qualifications so that they could be employable. Now this itself is changing as demand these days are for people who possess some particular skills.



The world is changing and you've got to flow with it or else you find yourself stuck and struggling. Getting a job is not so easy, and it would hurt if you saw a good job but you're not fit for it because you didn't have the right skill. If you still think that education is THE only key to success, ask some of those who got the highest qualification who work in places far beneath them. Ask some of those who had to switch and become entrepreneurs because of the stifling economy. Their reply would be a resounding "NO"



Check this out. In a year, Nigeria spits out over 600,000 graduates to join the 25 million unemployed youths struggling to get a decent job. If you think the labor market is easy, think again. Learning a skill is good but learning the right skill is even better.
