Amid the scare and frenzy which coronavirus brings, there is still good news we get regarding breakthroughs in the fight of COVID-19. A Warri based software development company, Apps-pot LLC has launched a mobile app ([COVID2GEDA](https://www.covid2geda.org)) to help curb the spread of this dreadful virus. It has very helpful features that the company hopes would help the Nigerian government in the fight of COVID-19. Basically, the app does three things; Contact Tracing, Symptoms Checking, and Geofencing.

This app allows users to get alerted when they come within a certain distance of an area with confirmed cases. It displays the number of affected people in a given location. It also has a symptoms checker for you to ascertain if you have COVID-19 or not. If a check comes out positive, the app has a feature that calculates the distance between your current location and a test center or isolation center. If one decides to reach out to the [NCDC](https://ncdc.gov.ng/), their number is right there on the app. Speaking with the CEO of Apps-pot LLC early last week, he said; "this is the first blue-tooth contact tracing mobile app in Africa and second in the world, after the first which was launched in Singapore on March 20th". He also said the mobile app is using a technology called B.L.E (Bluetooth low energy) which helps in scanning for other users of the app who enabled contact tracing on it.

With this technology, the app is able to continually scan for other users while the phone is turned on. The moment any user is less than 2 meters of anybody, the app automatically records it as close contact and generates a unique id which will help in identifying those you have come in close contact with, and if by any means any of them is tested positive for COVID-19 you will be alerted.  How helpful, while we try our best to maintain social distance as much as we can,  there's an app to make it easier for us by notifying us if we're in any trouble.

Speaking with him, he also said that the app stores everybody you have come in contact with on your phone on the history page of the app. This is a huge break for users as they can easily know if those they've come in contact with have the virus or have been exposed to it. 

According to the CEO, Mavino Micheal, he said the initiative is a response to the current pandemic and might not be available after the pandemic. Regardless, we are relieved about this break and really look forward to when it would be in full use. You can download the app [here](https://www.covid2geda.org/covid.apk).
