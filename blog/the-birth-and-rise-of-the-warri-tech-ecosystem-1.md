### A Small Group of Resilient Collaborators made a difference

*(Read [Part 1](https://techamplifier.africa/warri-tech-ecosystem-emergence-1) here)*

*"Then God went down to see the city and the tower that the sons of men had built. God then said: Look! They are one people with one language, and this is what they have started to do. Now there is nothing that they may have in mind to do that will be impossible for them.” - Genesis 11: 5, 6*

“**There is nothing that … will be impossible for them**.” Those were the words of the Almighty when he looked down from heaven to observe what some small group of determined men were doing some five thousand years ago. Had the Almighty not stopped those guys, they probably would  have succeeded in building the first skyscraper ever. The lesson from that Bible verse is clear: **nothing (except the Almighty) can stop a group of determined individuals who are united in thoughts and actions towards a common goal**.

That Scriptural text helped Paul appreciate the power of collaboration and resilience. He became more determined to continue seeking like-minded individuals in Warri to collaborate with, to build his dream tech ecosystem. Forging ahead, he formed a new social media platform called ‘Warri Startups Development Foundation’ ([WAFSDEF](https://twitter.com/wafsdef)) and started using it to propagate his vision online.

One fateful day, Paul stumbled into a tweet by [New Warri](https://twitter.com/newwarri) asking Waffirians to share their vision for a new Warri with them. Paul quickly jumped on the tweet and shared his vision for Tech Warri. Three weeks later, Paul met with [Collins Azuike](https://twitter.com/azuike1) *(the guy behind the tweet)* and shared more info with him. Paul asked Collins to link him up with [Igho Tietie](https://twitter.com/IghoTietie) *(aka Warri Update)* a prominent social media influencer. Collins obliged, and the next day Paul had a meeting with Igho. Later, Igho introduced Paul to [Tobore Adakaraza](https://twitter.com/ToboreDavids), a tech enthusiast and pastor shaping minds in Warri to pursue excellence and change the narrative on Warri. Pastor Tobore commended Paul for his vision and gave him some helpful advice. Later he linked him up with [Oreva Akakasi](https://facebook.com/mistar.naija)*.* Not long after that, at a social gathering for entrepreneurs *(tagged [The MIX](https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=1345993372181865&set=a.1345969098850959))* organised by [Connect Hub](https://connecthub.ng/), Paul met other great minds in likes [Mofe Onatseye](https://twitter.com/Mowizo6ix), [Anita Okiotor](https://twitter.com/afeeturi), and [Tobore Didaskalos](https://twitter.com/IamDidaskalos). He shared his vision of Tech Warri with them and they were in. The following day a meeting was scheduled at Chicken Republic Airport Road. [Alex Okome](https://twitter.com/OkomeAlex) and [Nancy Ugbor](https://twitter.com/nancypeters711) also joined the meeting and at the end of the day a new tech-startup community named ‘Delta Technology Entrepreneurship and Collaboration Hub’ – [DTECH](https://twitter.com/DTECH_Ng) was formed. The plan was for DTECH to be the corporate entity to drive the ecosystem's vision to reality.

Two months later on August 26 2017, DTECH organized its first event tagged ‘Warri Tech Hangout’. The event was successful. Over 30 persons RSVP’d. Some tech enthusiasts who attended the Hangout include [Nancy Ugbor](https://twitter.com/nancypeters711), [Chukwudi Chigbundu](https://twitter.com/topchuqs), the Idehen brothers [Kelly](https://twitter.com/IconicKelx) & [Scofield](https://twitter.com/Scofield_Idehen) and [Oghenero Israel](https://twitter.com/sieomcsheda). Some Waffirians in the diaspora also RSVP’d for the event but were unable to join in via video call. One such person was [Edirin Atumah](https://twitter.com/bongosway) a software testing consultant working in the UK.

Like Paul, Edirin is also passionate about tech thriving in Warri. He was in town around September/October 2017 to organise a two days hackathon tagged [HackWarri](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23HackWarri&src=typed_query). He reached out to Paul to help out with getting developers/designers in the city to attend and participate in the hackathon. Paul agrees and the next day both of went to town to talk to tech enthusiasts in the city to take part in the hackathon. It was around this time Paul met people like [Monica Yeresha](https://twitter.com/MoniqueYeresha), [Kenneth Ijama](https://twitter.com/teamwebbravo), [Tega Ovie](https://twitter.com/princetegaton), [Uvie Jakpor](https://twitter.com/UvieJakpor), [Joseph Ijekeye](https://www.facebook.com/joseph.ijekeye), [Frank Waive](https://twitter.com/FrankWaive), and [Omawumi Eyekpimi](https://twitter.com/LeBelleAmi). The hackathon was a success.After the hackathon ended, everyone returned to how they were before. But not Paul. He kept on thinking about the hackathon; how can build on it and grow a tech community community. Without hesitation he took action. He invited a dozen friends and acquaintances for a meeting at Chicken Republic Airport Road on the 5th of November 2017, but only five persons *(Kelly, Igho, Omawumi, Uvie, and Joseph)* showed up. Paul shared his vision for tech Warri with them and they showed interest. Then and there, [Warri Tech Network](https://twitter.com/warritechnetwok) (WTN) was formed.

Three weeks later, on the 25 of November 2017 WTN held its first meetup and boom “everywhere burst” as Warri people will say. The meetup was a huge success. There were more than 50 tech enthusiasts in attendance. It was one of the most memorable meetups ever held in the ecosystem. Everyone was on fire and hungry to learn and do more for Tech Warri. One guy enjoyed the meetup so much he suggested that it should be happening every Saturday. The moment Paul has been waiting for have arrived. Without delay he created [Warri Tech Community WhatsApp Group](https://chat.whatsapp.com/LW6TBLaosXAEQRFbtViUiE) and added to the group, everyone that is enthusiastic about tech in Warri, shares the group’s vision and agrees to abide by its Community Guidelines. That was how little by little, the Warri tech community grew from a few dozens when it started, to thousands today. It kept growing in size and in-depth.

The Warri tech community witnessed exponential growth the following year (2018) Paul and his friends kicked off the New Year with a bang. They figured out that, one of the biggest obstacle hindering technology growth in the city was *lack of public awareness for technology and its potential*. So they organized a one-week tech awareness campaign tagged Warri Tech Awareness Week ([\#WATAW18](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23WATAW18&src=)) The first of its kind. They visited universities and colleges, radio stations, shopping malls, motor-parks and marketplaces; basically everywhere people are crowded, preaching tech adoption to Waffiirians. They encouraged young people to pick up new skills in tech that can help them empower themselves and family and help transform the city. They encouraged businesses in the city - small and big -  to make good use of technology in driving their businesses, and to also patronize the world-class technology products being built each week by tech enthusiasts in the city. A summit (Warri Tech Awareness Summit) was held on the last day of the campaign. Many youths responded positively to the message to get into tech. A lot of them came forward during and after the campaign, and asked for guidance on how to get started in tech.

What followed next was a massive tech empowerment campaign in the city. Experienced developers in the community volunteered to assist hundreds of youths to learn how to code for free. WTN organized various free coding programs for the youths such as [TechPowerment](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23Techpowerment&src=typed_query) and [WarriGirlsCode](https://twitter.com/warrigirlscode) to help them learn how to code and use that skill to better their lives and the city. Tech meetups were organized regularly to provide hands-on assistance to beginners who may be having blockers and to also keep the fire burning in the community. As the months roll by, other tech/startup communities started springing up from within the ecosystem. The likes of [Warri Tech Women](https://twitter.com/warritechwomen), [forLoop Warri](https://twitter.com/forLoopWarri), [Startup Grind](https://twitter.com/SGWarri), [ALC Warri](https://twitter.com/hashtag/alcwarri?src=hashtag_click), [Google Developers Group](https://twitter.com/gdg_warri), [Facebook Developers Cycle Warri](https://www.facebook.com/groups/625532431263640), [GitlabNG](https://www.meetup.com/GitLab-Nigeria-Community/), [Kotlin Warri User Group](https://www.meetup.com/Kotlin-Warri/), [Skysenx DevComm](https://skysenx.com/devcomm), [Webflow Warri](https://www.meetup.com/Warri-Webflow-Meetup/) and many others. All these different communities contributed one way or the other to the growth, diversity, and depth we see in the Warri  tech ecosystem today. The ecosystem has grown from a few dozen tech enthusiasts some years ago to over ten thousand tech enthusiasts today, and still counting.

But there is more to the ecosystem than just a growing number of tech enthusiasts. There are now six technology hubs in the city, [Waffii Hub](https://warriinnovationhub.com/), [Skysenx Hub](https://skysenx.com/), [Connect Hub](https://connecthub.ng/), [Learn Hub Africa](https://learnhub.africa) among others. The ecosystem also has lots of awesome tech startups with high-growth potentials. The likes of [LessStress](https://twitter.com/lessstressomm), [Linkorion](https://linkorion.com), [Nemo](https://nemo.com.ng/), [Perfect-Ikon](https://perfect-ikon.com), [Brainstaq](https://brainstaq.com), [Soft-Kodes](https://soft-kodes.com/), [BookAMechanic](https://bookamechanic.com.ng), [XchangeWaste](https://xchangewaste.com), [DataDepot](https://datadepot.com), [Unicus](https://www.unicus.live/), [Da-Manager](https://www.da-manager.com/), [Ajiozi Ltd](https://ajiozi.com/) and many others. There are also some great law-firms and accounting-firms in the ecosystem providing startups with needed legal, financial services. [Amalgam Legal](http://www.amalgamlegal.com/) and [Jurisciti](https://jurisciti.com/) are among the top startup-centric law firms around. An angel investor’s network ([DAIN](https://twitter.com/deltaangelnetwk)) will soon launch operations in the region. Also, the three tertiary institutions ([Fupre](https://fupre.edu.ng/), [PTI](https://pti.edu.ng/), and [COEWA](https://www.coewarri.edu.ng/)) that are in the city are now more supportive and open to partnership opportunities between them and local tech communities. If things continue at this rate, the Warri tech ecosystem in the no-distant future will become a force to reckon with in the global tech space.

But all this did not happen by chance. The growth we see today in the Warri tech ecosystem is as a result of dedication, self-sacrifice, collaborative and consistent efforts by a few individuals. They chose to stay behind to the ecosystem of their dream. They made huge sacrifices to get this ecosystem off the ground, and to where it is today. They expended themselves, time, money, and connections for the growth of the ecosystem. The final part of this article ([Part 3](https://techamplifier.africa/warri-tech-ecosystem-emergence-3)) is dedicated to acknowledging these selfless men and women, Warri unsung tech heroes who helped re-write history in Warri. Stay with me.
