### The Unsung Tech Heroes transforming Warri

*(Read part [Part 2](https://techamplifier.africa/warri-tech-ecosystem-emergence-2) here)*



*“In time there arose over Egypt a new king, who did not know Joseph.” - Exodus 1: 8*

The Biblical Joseph was a former Prime Minister of Egypt. He practically saved the entire human race from being wiped out of existence by a terrible famine that affected the world some four thousand years ago. If Joseph was alive today, he would be as famous and respected as the Scientist who finds the cure to Coronavirus. Sadly, Joseph’s legacy didn’t last long in Egyptian history books. A new pharaoh who failed history classes decided to undermine all of Joseph’s legacy. Why did the pharaoh forget Joseph's great deeds? Could it be because there were no records of Joseph’s heroic acts? Or perhaps there was but it wasn’t passed along to the new pharaoh. Whatever it the reason was, the Bible didn’t say. But what we do know is that the new pharaoh *“didn’t know Joseph”*.If he had known Joseph, what he did for Egypt and his forefathers a few years back, he probably would have not tried to destroy Joseph’s legacy.

What’s the lesson here? ***Always document your process and milestones, and make sure you keep them in a safe place especially if you’d like future generations to learn and benefit from your story*.** When people learn of how others before them worked very hard to selflessly build platforms that they and others are now benefiting from, they are likely to feel grateful and inspired to engage in selfless service themselves. It is why ***this story about the emergence of the Warri tech ecosystem is being told; to inspire other young people especially Africans to believe in themselves and their dreams – no matter how big it is – that it can be achieved. It’s only a matter of time.*** If a small group of tech enthusiasts in a third world county who had no monies or connections just ideas, passion and some tech skills could succeed in starting a movement as massive as a tech ecosyste then anyone in any part of the world who also believes in themselves and their dreams, are willing to collaborate with others, and remain focused and resolute as they pursue such dream,  can and will surely succeed.

Granted, the road to success may be fraught with challenges but they can be overcome. The young men and women who championed the tech revolution we are seeing in Warri today had their own share of challenges but they overcame them all. They didn’t allow anything or anyone to come between them and the ecosystem’s growth. There were times when misunderstandings, disagreements, and the selfish pursuit of personal agenda, almost threatened the unity and progress of the ecosystem. But they remained focused and displayed maturity by letting go of hate and grievances and embracing love and forgiveness. ***They placed the growth of the ecosystem above their individual visions and interests***. They never lost sight of the big picture. They know that everyone benefits when the ecosystem wins. Of course ***there are times when competition is unavoidable, still collaboration is possible***. The sky is big enough for everyone so what's the point of fighting over airspace. There were times when people who served as ‘pillars of the ecosystem’ relocated to other cities and it seemed the ecosystem was going to collapse but it didn’t. Instead it waxed stronger. At times small money to rent halls for meetups or buy snacks for meetup attendees is a challenge. Still these guys manage to maneuver and organise meetups upon meetups back to back. Countless times they wrote to governments, big and small companies, wealthy individuals, and people of influence within/outside the city for support, to enable them undertake one or two tech project designed to help the youths in the city become empowered and financially independent, but doors were slammed on their faces. Only a few cared and gave help. Many times they will travel from Warri to Lagos – *without being sure of where they will stay or how they will return* –to seek partnership opportunities that will bring home to develop their beloved Warri tech ecosystem. There were times when families and friends would mock and pressure them to quit their careers in tech and switch to a different line of business because the hustle wasn’t paying then and there are tons of bills to pay. But didn’t quit. They stayed true to the game and today the hustle is gradually paying off and the same people are celebrating them, forming fan-boys and fan-girls.

Time will fail us if we say we should narrate all the various challenges our ‘Warri Tech Heroes’ overcame to get the ecosystem off the ground and running today. Their success story is an inspiration to youths everywhere. As we celebrate in our progress as an ecosystem we realize that there are still plenty of rooms for improvement in the ecosystem. For the ecosystem to continue to grow and attain the heights of Silicon Valley, it needs things like (a) fast internet broadband connectivity (b) more innovation and acceleration hubs (c) increased investments opportunities for the many startups we have in the ecosystem that has incredibly high-growth potentials (d) support from the state and local governments (e) better media coverage (f) and big tech companies operating in places like Lagos, Kenya, Rwanda, etc., to bring their programs or products to Warri to explore the market and provide opportunities for its talented techies as they are doing in other cities. The more world-class and thriving tech ecosystems we have across Africa, the more Africans benefit. The continent is big enough, rich enough, and blessed enough with abundant talents to support as many as tech ecosystems that emerge. Let’s support the growth of these various tech ecosystems springing up every year in different cities across Africa in the little ways we can, because when we do we are contributing to the prosperity of the continent and its people. – **\#SupportWarriTechEcosystem**

The story of Warri tech ecosystem will not be complete without given due recognition to some selfless individuals/companies who have supported the ecosystem's growth in one way or the other. Some of this support came in the form of cash. Others in the form of advice. Some used  their connections to open doors for the ecosystem by introducing its leaders to potential partners/investors. Why others used their platforms to broadcast some projects that took place in the ecosystem. Some made championing the ecosystem their full-time job. They planned, organized, and attended countless tech events and programs, expending their time, energy, and money in the process. All these individuals and companies listed below, including the others not mentioned in this article are the true heroes of the Warri tech ecosystem. Thank you all and may God bless us all.

**Shout-outs**

For hosting WTN's meetings in your houses/offices. For expending your time, energy and money for WTN's cause, especially in your capacity of board of trustees. Our ecosystem has grown today no small thanks to your efforts and sacrifices. Thank you [Clifford](https://twitter.com/Sircliffjoe) for offering your office space to be used for meetups. Shout outs to [Collins](https://twitter.com/rombo_e), [](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danielose/)[Ben](https://twitter.com/ojbilly), [Laye](https://twitter.com/LayeEselemo), [Dan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danielose/) and [Loya](https://twitter.com/IamIkhiloya) for your consistently supporting our ecosystem financially.

If not for your generous donations, we probably still wouldn't have an innovation hub ([Waffii Hub](<*[Warri Innovation Hub](https://warriinnovationhub.com/)*>)) of our own today. Thank you. Thank you and thank you again. May the Almighty bless and richly reward you too for your kind and generous hearts. Last but not least, I'll like to give a very big shout out to on of Africa's finest tech community managers I'm privilege to work closely with ([Timothy Ovie](https://twitter.com/timothy_ovie)) Without your support, I certainly wouldn't have been able to do much in this ecosystem. You are an extraordinary human being Tim. You a brother, business-partner and friend. May God bless us all and Warri tech ecosystem now and in the years ahead.
