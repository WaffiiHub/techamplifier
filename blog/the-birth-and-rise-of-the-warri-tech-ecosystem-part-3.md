### \[The Unsung Heroes who transformed a city]

*“In time there arose over Egypt a new king, who did not know Joseph.” - Exodus 1: 8*

The Biblical Joseph was a former Prime Minister of Egypt. He practically saved the entire human race from being wiped out of existence by a terrible famine that affected the world some four thousand years ago. If Joseph was alive today, he would be as famous and respected as the Scientist who finds the cure to Coronavirus. Sadly, Joseph’s legacy didn’t last long in Egyptian history books. A new pharaoh who failed history classes decided to undermine all of Joseph’s legacy. Why did the pharaoh forget Joseph's great deeds? Could it be because there were no records of Joseph’s heroic acts? Or perhaps there was but it wasn’t passed along to the new pharaoh. Whatever it the reason was, the Bible didn’t say. But what we do know is that the new pharaoh *“didn’t know Joseph”*.If he had known Joseph, what he did for Egypt and his forefathers a few years back, he probably would have not tried to destroy Joseph’s legacy.

What’s the lesson here? *Always document your process and milestones, and make sure you keep them in a safe place especially if you’d like future generations to learn and benefit from your story*. It’s a known fact everywhere that when people learn of how others before them worked very hard to selflessly build platforms that they and others are now benefiting from, they are likely going to feel grateful and inspired to engage in selfless service themselves. It is why this story about the emergence of the Warri tech ecosystem is being told; to inspire other young people especially Africans to believe in themselves and their dreams – no matter how big that dream is – that it is achievable. It’s just a matter of time. If a small group of tech enthusiasts in a “third world county” who had no monies or mentors to guide them just ideas, passion and some tech skills could succeed in starting a movement as massive as a tech ecosystem then anyone in any part of the world who believes in their dreams, are willing to collaborate with others, and remain focused and resolute in the pursuit of their dreams can and will surely succeed at the tail end.

Granted, the road to success may be fraught with many challenges but it is possible to overcome them all. The young men and women who championed the Warri tech ecosystem vision and took it to where it is today had their fair share of challenges but they overcame. They didn’t allow anything or anyone to come between them and the ecosystem’s growth. There were times when misunderstandings, disagreements, and the selfish pursuit of personal agenda, almost threatened the unity and progress of the ecosystem. But they displayed their maturity by letting go of hate and grievances and embracing love and forgiveness. They placed the growth of the ecosystem above their individual visions and interests. They never lost sight of the big picture. They understand everyone benefits when the ecosystem wins. Although there are times when competitions are unavoidable, still collaboration is possible. The sky is big enough for everyone so there is no point fighting over airspace. There were times when people who served as ‘pillars of the ecosystem’ moved away to other cities and it seemed the ecosystem is going to collapse, but it didn’t. Instead it waxed stronger. At times small money to rent halls for meetups or buy snacks for meetup attendees can be a challenge still, they maneuvered and held meetups upon meetups back to back. Countless times they wrote to governments, big and small companies, wealthy individuals, and people of influence within/outside the city for support to undertake one or two tech project helps youths in the city become empowered and financially independent, but doors were slammed on their faces. Only a few good people cared and gave help. Many times they will travel from Warri to Lagos – *without being sure of where they will stay or how they will return* –to seek partnership opportunities that will bring home to develop their beloved Warri tech ecosystem. There were times when families and friends would mock and pressure them to quit their careers in tech and switch to a different line of business because the hustle wasn’t paying then and there are tons of bills to pay. But didn’t quit. They stayed true to the game and today the hustle is gradually paying off and the same people are celebrating them, forming fan-boys and fan-girls.

Time will fail us if we say we should narrate all the various challenges our ‘Warri Tech Heroes’ overcame to get the ecosystem off the ground and running today. Their success story is an inspiration to youths everywhere. As we celebrate in our progress as an ecosystem we realize that there are still plenty of rooms for improvement in the ecosystem. For the ecosystem to continue to grow and attain the heights of Silicon Valley, it needs things like (a) fast internet broadband connectivity (b) more innovation and acceleration hubs (c) increased investments opportunities for the many startups we have in the ecosystem that has incredibly high-growth potentials (d) support from the state and local governments (e) better media coverage (f) and big tech companies operating in places like Lagos, Kenya, Rwanda, etc., to bring their programs or products to Warri to explore the market and provide opportunities for its talented techies as they are doing in other cities. The more world-class and thriving tech ecosystems we have across Africa, the more Africans benefit. The continent is big enough, rich enough, and blessed enough with abundant talents to support as many as tech ecosystems that emerge. Let’s support the growth of these various tech ecosystems springing up every year in different cities across Africa in the little ways we can, because when we do we are contributing to the prosperity of the continent and its people. – **\#SupportWarriTechEcosystem**

The success story of the Warri tech ecosystem cannot be complete without given due recognition and expressing profound gratitude to some benevolent individuals/companies *(listed below)* who have given some kind of support to the ecosystem one way or the other that helped it grow to its current stage today. Some of this support came in the form of cash. Others in the form of advice. Some used their connections to open doors for the ecosystem by introducing its leaders to potential partners/investors. Why others used their platforms to broadcast some projects that took place in the ecosystem. Some made championing the ecosystem their full-time job. They planned, organized, and attended countless tech events and programs, expending their time, energy, and money in the process. All these individuals and companies listed below, including the others not mentioned in this article are the true heroes of the Warri tech ecosystem. Thank you all and may God bless us all.
