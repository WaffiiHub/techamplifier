WARRI is a small cosmopolitan city in southern Nigeria famous for its once-booming oil industry and its unique variation of the Nigerian Pidgin English. The average Waffirian is very talented and highly motivated. The city has produced some of Africa’s biggest and finest entertainers. The likes of Alibaba, Richard Mofe Damijo, Igo Die, AY, Bovi, Omawumi, Harry Song, Erigga, and many others. Many of these famous entertainers as well as other illustrious sons/daughters of Warri has helped put the city on the map. But there is more to Warri than just oil, a unique lingua-franca, and a bunch of successful entertainers. Warri is a city of possibilities. The city inspires belief in its inhabitants. Warri shapes your mind to believe that anything/everything is possible; to dream big and work hard in pursuit of your dreams. Warri teaches you to be resourceful, resilient, and never give up until you attain success. You can’t live in Warri and be a dullard. No way. The city forces you to be smart and to adopt a winning-mentality. No wonder the popular saying “Warri no de carry last”. It is this unique Warri culture that inspired a young man to take upon himself the mammoth task of championing the establishment of a world-class, thriving tech ecosystem in Warri. But just what is a tech ecosystem? How will it benefit Warri and its people? How and when did the Warri tech ecosystem movement start?

A technology ecosystem is an interdependent, independent network of various actors that combine to create innovative products and services in tech. Tech ecosystems benefit their host cities and neighboring communities in several ways. Take Silicon Valley for example. It has created over a hundred thousand direct, high-paying tech jobs with average annual salaries of $140,000 per person – twice the US national average. For each tech-job the sector creates, there are approximately 4.3 jobs created*(multiplier effect)*in other local goods and services sectors across all income groups, including lawyers, dentists, schoolteachers, cooks, and retail clerks, among many others. Warri can reap similar benefits if it has a thriving tech ecosystem in it like Silicon Valley. The idea to establish a tech ecosystem in Warri was conceived on July 22nd, 2016 when Paul Okoro*(a Warri based Tech Enthusiasts and Startup Founder)*attended a two-day technology conference*(TechPlus2016)*in Lagos. At that conference he saw for the first time how the various actors of a tech ecosystem interact to create awesomeness. He saw thousands of tech enthusiasts – developers, designers, startup founders, innovators, exhibitors, investors, gamers, etc. – from all works of life from different countries, come together under one roof to engage, learn and collaborate in tech. He instantly fell in love with the whole idea of a tech ecosystem and wanted one in his beloved city Warri. So there and then he made inquiries on what it would take to organize a large and successful tech gathering in Warri like TechPlus2016. He later realized that before Warri can host such a large tech conference she will first have a growing tech ecosystem that teems with thousands of tech enthusiasts. That was the beginning of Paul’s journey as Tech Ecosystem Architect and Champion.

On returning to Warri, Paul swung to action right away by sharing his new vision with some of his friends, family members. But the feedback wasn’t encouraging. The majority of the people he spoke to didn’t understand what a tech ecosystem is or how it works. Others did not believe such a thing can work in Warri. Sadly, Paul allowed the fear of these people to get to him and that made him slow down. But he never lost sight of the vision. A few months later, while working on his startup (LessStress) online micro-jobs marketplace a friend*(Adjosho Ojiyovwi aka AJ - a Fullstack Developer)*a need arise for more developers to join in the project, but sadly none was found. LessStress suffered a serious blow as a result. Frustrated by the situation, Paul said to AJ,*“I wish we get a tech ecosystem for Warri here like the one for Silicon Valley, e for no hard us to find a developer to join us work on this our project.”*AJ replied him sarcastically saying;*“no be your mate nai start the tech community for San Francisco wey later turn into the world’s biggest tech ecosystem today? Start your own small tech community for Warri today, who knows one day e fit grow into a thriving tech ecosystem like Silicon Valley”*. Unknown to AJ, those little words stroke a cord in Paul’s heart and rekindled his passion for championing the establishment of a tech ecosystem in Warri. Paul spent the remainder of that day researching and studying Silicon Valley; how it came about, what makes it stands out from other tech ecosystems in the world and how it can be replicated in other cities. The next day Paul set out on a mission in search of developers residing in Warri, or environs. He searched online and offline, in the streets of Warri visiting one office to another. At the end of the day, the effort paid off. A handful of tech enthusiasts were found and immediate arrangements were made for a tech meetup. The meetup took place at Paul’s office*(then situated at kilometer 1 Refinery Road, besides Joma foods, Effurun, Delta state)*. After that first meetup, an online tech community (Warri Developers Forum - aka WDF) was formed and the small group of tech enthusiasts who attended that first meetup started using that forum to engage with one another on tech-related matters. But WDF didn’t last long. Members kept relocating from Warri to other cities in search of greener pastures and gradually activities died out in the group so it was packed up. Although disappointed by the outcome of WDF, Paul didn’t lose hope. The Warri-resilient-spirit didn’t let him. He kept on searching for like-minds he could work within building his dream Warri tech ecosystem. But he will have to wait till around mid-2017 before he will find a new crop of tech enthusiasts to work with.
